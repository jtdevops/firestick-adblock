# Firestick DNS Adblocking/blocking scripts

Install these scripts with TWRP to block ads, or firestick updates.

If you block the updates, you cannot do a factory reset of the deive otherwise your device will become unupdatable when it tries to initially set it up again, and it will become bricked, unless you unbrick your device, which I explain how I overcame this isue in another github repo.
